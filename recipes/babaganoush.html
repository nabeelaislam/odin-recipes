       Behind Babaganoush
   </h2>
   
   <p>
       <strong>Babaganoush,</strong> also known as Mutabbal, is an appetizer across the Middle East. It serves as part of a mezze or with pita/any bread source as an appetizer or snack. 
       
   </p>

   <p>In our family, Babaganoush holds a special place as a beloved dish, bringing us the comforting embrace of authentic home-cooked food that connects us to our Iranian roots and culture.
    </p>
    <p>
    During Ramadan, this dip becomes the star of our table, a cherished favorite as we break our fast with warm pita and indulge in spoonfuls of Babaganoush.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, beyond the holy month, this dish remains a perfect go-to snack, easy to prepare, wholesome, and utterly addictive.
</p>
<p>
    With every creamy bite, we savor the flavors that have been passed down through generations, a testament to the enduring love and appreciation for our culinary heritage.

   <ol>
       <li>Rost the eggplans by stove, oven, or grill. (The best is on the grill for smoky flavor).</li>
       <li>Once the eggplants are well-cooked, spoon out the inner part of the eggplant, and put it in a strainer to get rid of excess water.</li>
       <li>Add the spooned eggplant to a large bowl.</li>
       <li>Add lemon juice, tahini, yogurt, garlic, and salt.</li>
       <li>Mix by hand (Baba doesn't use utensils).</li>
       <li>Once well mixed, pour the dip on a flat plate.</li>
       <li>Decorate the dish with black pepper, sumac, and paprika.</li>
       <li>Using a small spoon, carve an indented path along the dish, commonly a circle/oval around the outer circumference of the dip. Or, place a circular indentation in the middle of the dip.  </li>
       <li>Pour olive oil in the weld you created.</li>
       <li>Let the dish rest in the refridgerater for at least 1-2 hours to let the dip cool and enhance the flavours.</li>
       <li>Enjoy with pita bread, pita chips, veggies, with a dish, or on its own!</li>
